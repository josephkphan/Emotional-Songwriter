This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-ife
I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
No, just don't wake me now
I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)
Oo-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
