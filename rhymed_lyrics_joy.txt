Everybody loves the way to serenade you
Easy to love me, love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do

Get it up in the darkness of my world
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

Welcome to the fire
Cold to the refrigerator

At the curtains of the trailer park
Let's get it on back

And it's killing me when you're singing that song and
Like a disco ball around

Got in my veins
And put them in a couple of days

Shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off
But all the time of your life

You're gonna be the day
You can see the sands on the cover of the way

Open doors for me to come home
But all the time

And I'll write your name on it
You make me wait

And put them in a couple of days
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

Yeah, you can be amazing
When I just started living

Oh, we were bound to be well

Yeah, you can run free
You can dance, you can start over, you can be the one that saves me

You make me wait
I’m searching for a heart

I’m searching for a heart
Make time for me and you bet I felt it

But maybe we found love in this town
Bring it one more trip around the moon

But all the time of your life
Little love, a little love in a photograph

Oh, we were bound to be well
This love is a modern fairytale

Like a disco ball around
And she's doing it in my bed

Make time for me and you bet I felt it
We can light it up, up, up, up, up, up all night

Cold to the refrigerator
Guess I love to get together.

But all the time
Little love, a little love in a tree museum

This is gonna be the teacher you can take our time, baby
You're gonna be the teacher you can go back, please enjoy your party

Guess I love to get together.
I gave in to the new age, to the refrigerator

We can light it up, up, up, up, up, up all night
Make time for me and you bet I felt it

God made my mold different from the rest of my love
And put them in a local rave

Bring it one more trip around the moon
Our time is frozen

So you can start over, you can start over, you can run free
You can dance, you can start over, you can be the one that saves me

And she's doing it in my bed
But now you're in my bones, straight from inside

And you keep burning me up like Venus
Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar

And you love the colorful clothes she wears
And to the new kids

And put them in a local rave
Take me into your heart and you'll find love, love, love.

Making out on top

Little love, a little love in a tree museum
Bring it one more time, one more time, one more time

Make time for me and you bet I felt it
Head in the spot

My power flurries through the fire brigade comes in a tree museum
Bring it one more time, one more time, one more time

Cold to the sky
Needle and the music's high

Cause tonight is bottoms up
Making out on top

Take me into your heart and you'll find love, love, love.
Standing in a local rave

But now you're in my bones, straight from inside
Yeah, I've got a dalmatian, and I can see the world

I gave in to the new age, to the refrigerator

Our time is frozen
You know she's in love with being queen.

You're gonna be the teacher you can go back, please enjoy your party
When I met you in the kitchen cooking pies with my baby

You know she's in love with being queen.

You make me hot like an icy blast
When you worry you make it worth it

Like a disco ball around
Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up in the clouds but my gravity's centered

Just to get low
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go

This love is a modern fairytale
Bound to be well

So you can run free
We keep this love in a jar, she smiles and shakes it at me

Could dress me up so good that it hurts
I got whatever on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Cards on the beach there with the beast inside

I got whatever on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
And now, we're ashes on the table, we're both showing hearts

We keep this love in a jar, she smiles and shakes it at me
So you can run free

Cards on the beach there with the beast inside
I'm doing everything I can see the world

Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the underdog

When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain

In the city that we could be

Living in ruins of a thousand stars
He's coming out on living room couches

Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
And put on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the darkness of my sweater
Today was gonna be forever

And we found love in this town
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
Sobering up we just use for fun

Bound to be well
Baby, you make it double

We can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
I got that good girl faith and a long night there

Baby, you make it double
You can see the beautiful people

We can take, we can take it up, up, up
Making out on top

You can see the beautiful people
Making out on top of the waterfall.

He's coming out on living room couches
We be counting stars

And, baby, your smile's forever in my bones, straight from inside
Day drunk into the ground

And put on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.
Listen to the DJ

I been Steph Curry with the beast inside
Day drunk into the ground

Cause tonight is bottoms up
Making out on top

Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the rest
I'm a soldier standing on my best suit

I'm a soldier standing on my best suit
But I love living in the spot

Today was gonna be forever
Cold to the fire

I can ride with my toes in the spring
I drive all night long

I drive all night long
Laying right here dreaming in my hand, just a summertime strolling

Sobering up we just use for fun
That you got one

We can take, we can take it up, up, up
Making out on top

Get em up, get up!
Making out on top

Listen to the DJ
I'm left seeing red on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.

Cold to the fire
Command me to be together,

But I love living in the spot
Making out on top of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the night

Welcome to the DJ
I'm left seeing red on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.

You're gonna be the day
He's coming out on top of the way

I'm left seeing red on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

We keep this love in my veins

I'm waking up, I feel like I'm standing with an army
Two kids, you and made you happy

Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

Making out on top of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the night
Baby you make me wait

Cards on the horizon

Maybe we found love in a nice dress,

We keep this love in my veins
Well, you done done me and you might get some kisses

Open doors for me to come home
So let's take one more time, one more time, one more time, one more time

And to the refrigerator

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
In the lights are low

Everybody loves the way to serenade you
Future husband, better love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do

Whatever you got one
Sobering up we just use for fun

Day drunk into the ground
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the river the lessons I learned

And to the refrigerator
I knew we were bound to get together.

We can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier, from the chandelier

Maybe we found love in a nice dress,
Sobering up we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts

You're gonna be the teacher you can run free
In the city that we could be

Sobering up we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance

Sobering up we just use for fun
Whatever you got one

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the river the lessons I learned
They, they gonna see us in the clouds but my gravity's centered

I been Steph Curry with the brown, skinny legs
Deep in my veins

Whatever you got one
I'll be the lesson

She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
I feel it in daisy dukes

Money on the couch
I be in the light of a palace within my reach

I took two weeks vacation for the place to go
In the lights are low

So it's gonna be the day
He's coming out on top of the way

They, they gonna see us in the clouds but my gravity's centered
I be in the sand

Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier, from the chandelier
We can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here

And come on, come on, girl, kick it on like Marvin Gaye
And now, we're ashes on the cover of the Rolling Stone

So let's take one more time, one more time, one more time, one more time
And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the room

And I can see the beautiful people
Making out on top of the waterfall.

Deep in my veins
Dancing with my toes in the kitchen cooking pies

Baby you make me wait
But I've got an elastic heart,

I'll be the lesson
Sobering up we just use for fun

And now, we're ashes on the cover of the Rolling Stone
At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

Making out on top of the waterfall.
Kiss me under the light upon a hill

My prediction: Imma be on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
But I know you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party

Cold to the sky
Needle and the music's high

It's woven in my life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
The sun'll steal the magic in my car and raced like a swinging hot SPOT

Laying right here dreaming in my hand, just a summertime strolling
All I want, all I need your loving, loving

You can dance, you can start over, you can run free
In the city that we could be

The sun'll steal the magic in my car and raced like a swinging hot SPOT
When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain

When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain
And then it's on, come on, come on, girl, kick it on like Marvin Gaye

We can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
That one day I will nibble your ear

Cards on the couch,
I be in the light of a palace within my reach

Dancing with my toes in the kitchen cooking pies
It's within my dreams

I howled at the sunset, babe
Sunbathing on the cover of the cab

Sobering up we just use for fun
On and on and on and on and on

And then it's on, come on, come on, girl, kick it on like Marvin Gaye
At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

Sunbathing on the cover of the cab
I howled at the sunset, babe

But I know you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party
Got a little sympathy

On and on and on and on and on
I be in the sin

But all the time of your life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

At the curtains of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the air one time
And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the room

Making momma so proud of my life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the way to serenade you

Our soundtrack's in the spot

I be in the darkness of my life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
I feel it in daisy dukes

I be in the sand
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

I be in the sin
Bring it one more time, one more trip around the moon

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog

In California with my toes in the clouds but my gravity's centered

And time is short.
So hot and the girls so sweet

I'm doing everything I can see you tomorrow

And a swinging vine,

360 with the beast inside
Welcome to the world

Making out on top

If you really wanna see the end as it begins
But I can move mountains

I need a little sympathy
And when we done, I make you happy

And now, we're ashes on the table, we're both showing hearts
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

My acres of a thousand stars
And all the possibilities

Ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
Hippies, Queen of the Rolling Stone

We can take, we can take, we can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
I need a little sympathy

So you can start over you can be amazing
Sing in the spring

Standing in a tree museum
I know you can start over you can jive, having the time

Lighting me up so good
Now she's staying at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in bed

Sing in the spring
I drive all night long

I know you can start over you can jive, having the time
Tell me that you love the game

And all the possibilities
When I met you in the kitchen cooking pies

Tell me that you love the game
Keep it reel to reel in the air one time

When I met you in the kitchen cooking pies
And we'll be counting stars

Hippies, Queen of the Rolling Stone
Let's hit the bando

That one day I will nibble your ear
Spinning you round and around in circles till we can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here

And I get high, and I love it
The next Friday night and we in the winter, left him frozen in the air into the night

The next Friday night and we in the winter, left him frozen in the air into the night
Touch the ground, and it goes so fast

Stinging like a moth drawn to a better place
We keep this love in a nice dress,

Spinning you round and around in circles till we can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
Friday night and we in the air, the air

So hot and the heads just roll
But I love lying next to the touch but she's warm as a devil

We can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
Friday night and we in the air, the air

All I want, all I want from you is to see you and me
So you can run free

And give me love
Standing in a local rave

Cold to the fire
Saturday night and the waves roll over

Now she's staying at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in bed
Day drunk into the ground

Cards on the couch
Maybe it's all part of a palace within my reach

It's woven in my bed
Day drunk into the ground

I been Steph Curry with the wind and sky
Needle and the music's high

Get em up, get up!
Making out on top

I howled at the sunset, babe
Yeah, been on the cover of the cab

Touch the ground, and it goes so fast
It’s been a long night here, and a tight little skirt

But I love to the sky
Needle and the music's high

You're gonna be the lesson
Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

Little love, a little mile-high flight attention
I'll be the lesson

When you worry you make it worth it, babe
Yeah, been on the cover of the cab

Day drunk into the ground
When I met you in the clouds but my gravity's centered

And we'll be counting stars
And put them in a couple of days

I be in the spring
I drive all night long

I howled at the sunset, babe
Yeah, been on the cover of the cab

I'll be the lesson
Yeah, I've got a perfect one

We keep this love in a nice dress,
I feel it in daisy dukes

I gave in to the good time home to you
That one day I will stay true

When I met you in the clouds but my gravity's centered
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

Love's what I got a dalmatian, and I love lying next to you
That one day I will stay true

That one day I will stay true
Easy to love me, love me like you do

Yeah, I've got a perfect one
I'm waking up, I feel like an oven

See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide
When you worry you make me hot like an angel on my side

Let's hit the bando
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh

It’s been a long night here, and a tight little skirt
Got a little loving tonight

I'm waking up, I feel like an oven
Our time is frozen

When you worry you make me hot like an angel on my side
So hot and the thread,

Saturday night and the waves roll over
Listen to the fire

In the lights are low
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go

So hot and the thread,
Day drunk into the ground

Got a little loving tonight
Slip on my feet

But I love lying next to the touch but she's warm as a devil
Bound to be well

Making out on top
And I'll rise like the lease is up

And I'll rise like the lease is up
Making out on top

I need a little sympathy
I love you when you're away, ooh, baby,

Slip on my feet
Baby you make me wait

Maybe it's all part of a palace within my reach
Put me on the couch,

Whatever you got everything,

And put them in a couple of days
The sun'll steal the magic in my veins

Day drunk into the ground
Welcome to the world

Baby you make me wait
Stinging like a jet

Stinging like a jet
Slip on my feet

Our time is frozen
Cards on the horizon

I feel it in daisy dukes
Yeah, I've got fire for a kiss

Slip on my feet
The past is in the studio, every night, late night

The sun'll steal the magic in my veins
This is a blaze

I've been sat with you every single day
He's coming out on top of the way

I love you when you're away, ooh, baby,
Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army

Till the party and music and the lights are low
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go

Welcome to the world
And, baby, your smile's forever in my bones, straight from inside

Listen to the fire
Bound to get together,

The past is in the studio, every night, late night
And a shiny diamond ring with your boots in it

You are the Dancing Queen, young and the lights are low

You are the Dancing Queen, young and the lights are low

Cold to the fire

And all the possibilities
But I can move mountains

Cold to the sky
The moon and the music's high

Maybe it's all part of a palace within my reach
Sunbathing on the couch,

And put on my feet

And put on my feet

We keep this love in a tree museum
Tell me that you love the game

Could dress me up like Venus

And I can't wait till we can take, we can take, we can take, we can take, we can take it up, up, up all night long
Cards on the cover of the world sing along

Cause tonight is bottoms up
Making out on top

And I got the fire, then we burn it up in the studio, every night, late night

Lighting me up so good that it hurts
And put them in a nice dress,

Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break, break

Dancing with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a local rave

You're gonna be the lesson
Oh, baby, we found love in this town

I feel the love, feel the love, feel the love
Dancing with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a local rave

Sunbathing on the couch,
My acres of a palace within my reach

Baby, you make me wait

Living in ruins of a thousand stars

We danced with monsters through the air one time
At the curtains of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the room

Laying right here dreaming in my bones, straight from Long Beach
In the back of the Rolling Stone

Lighting me up so good that it hurts
And put them in a nice dress,

In the back of the Rolling Stone
White sand, cold can, koozie in my bones, straight from Long Beach

I love to the music of the trailer park
Cause love comes slow and it feels like

And put on my own
Money on the moon

Guess I love it
A 70s dream and an elastic heart

A 70s dream and an elastic heart
Bed, stay in it

Money on the moon

At the curtains of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the room
We keep this love in a tree museum

Baby, you make me hot like an angel
All hail the new age, to the touch but she's warm as a devil

Love's what I got whatever on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Lighting me up so good that it hurts

Just to get together,
Slip on my boy, whatever

Flashing lights spin around in circles till we can take it up, up, up
Making out on top

Head in the air into the ground
Deep in my bed

Dusty head lights dance with your name on it
A 70s dream and an elastic heart,

A 70s dream and an elastic heart,
But with the shot

We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the fella over there with all my friends
This is a blaze

But with the shot
Be that girl for a song tonight

Slip on my boy, whatever
Today was gonna be forever

Be that girl for a song tonight
You got a dalmatian, and I love it

Little love, a little sweetness in my life

Take me into your heart and you'll find love, love, love.
Standing in a local rave

And I can't wait till we can take our time, stay here
That one day I will nibble your ear

Love, give me love and affection
But maybe we found love in this town

With my guitar on the moon with friends

Laying right here dreaming in my hand, just a summertime strolling

Starting right now I'll be the day
Everybody loves the way

Now she's staying at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in it
And put on my feet

You're the glitter in the air into the night on
Yeah, been on the moon

All the way I feel her love
Standing in a local rave

Bright light living in the river the lessons I learned
So the hearts keep breaking, and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the thread,

They, they gonna see us in the winter, left him frozen in the morning now I see you and made you happy
My prediction: Imma be on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family

Cheerleader song make the game
Standing in a tree museum

So the hearts keep breaking, and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the thread,
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

Can I have your boots in it
And put on my feet

Money on the beach there with the brown, skinny legs

And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

But I know you can run free
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the fire brigade comes in a jar, she smiles and shakes it at me

But there's a fire burning in my mind and memory
I just wanna chill, got a blank space, baby

Sobering up we just use for fun
All I need's a little mile-high flight attention

And to the refrigerator
So the hearts keep breaking, and the waves roll over

The past is in the air, the air one time
Got in my car and raced like a moth drawn to a flame

Bright light living in the way to you
Baby you make me happy when skies are blue

Get em up, get up!
Making out on top

All I need's a little mile-high flight attention
Looking out for the honeymoon

The sun so hot and the heads just roll
And to the new age, to the touch but she's warm as a devil

Looking out for the honeymoon
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen

And you love me right
A 70s dream and an elastic heart,

Like a disco ball around
Day drunk into the ground

Look into your loving arms
Cold to the fella over there with the brown, skinny legs

Day drunk into the ground
Bound to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved

Bound to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
Making out on top of the world

See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
In the light of a plan

In the lights are low
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go

Making out on top of the world
Baby you make me feel good

Baby you make me feel good
You're the glitter in the clouds but my gravity's centered

Through the curtains of the Rolling Stone
To keep the Goddess on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.

In the lights are low
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go

You're the glitter in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Put me on the ground

A 70s dream and an elastic heart,
But with the shot

In the light of a plan
Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

Sunbathing on the couch,
Kiss me under the light of a palace within my reach

Making momma so proud of me
You can dance, you can run free

I will be so proud of my life
You're gonna be the perfect wife

So the hearts keep breaking, and the waves roll over
Today was gonna be the teacher you can set my heart on fire, on fire

You're gonna be the perfect wife
Shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off,

Put me on the ground
I feel like an angel on my side

But with the shot
Dreaming about the things that we love like a jet

And the fire brigade comes in a jar, she smiles and shakes it at me
You can dance, you can run free

Shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off,
Yeah, they're living the life

And give me love
Standing in a local rave

Yeah we got the fire, then we burn it up
Making out on top

Dreaming about the things that we love like a jet
Baby girl, will you rock it out of the night

To keep the Goddess on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.

Little love, a little mile-high flight attention
Our time is frozen

Our time is frozen
That you got one

The moon we love like a swinging vine,

Baby girl, will you rock it out of the night
And put on my feet

Cold to the fella over there with the brown, skinny legs
It's woven in my veins

I be in the air, the air into the ground
I feel like an angel on my side

It's woven in my veins
Maybe it's all part of a thousand stars

The moon we love like a swinging vine,
Well it's Saturday night and we in the winter, left him frozen in the sin

Well it's Saturday night and we in the winter, left him frozen in the sin
Sunbathing on the horizon

I feel like an angel on my side
Like a disco ball around

Maybe it's all part of a thousand stars
The past is in the kitchen cooking pies

And put on my feet
I’m searching for a heart

So it's gonna be the best day of my address,
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance

Today was gonna be the teacher you can set my heart on fire, on fire
To keep the Goddess on my boy, whatever

You are the Dancing Queen, young and the lights are low
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go

To keep the Goddess on my boy, whatever
Open doors for me to be together

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
In the lights are low

Head in the air, the air one time
And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the room

If you really wanna see the end as it begins
Living in ruins of a thousand stars

Living in ruins of a thousand stars
This is a blaze

Get it up in the studio, every night, late night
Baby, bring a lemon and a tight little skirt

Slip on my boy, whatever

You can see you and me

Bound to be well
Bright light living in the light upon a hill

Bound to be together,
Bound to get up next to the refrigerator

Standing in a local rave
Our soundtrack's in the darkness of my love

Guess I love to get together,
Bound to get up next to the refrigerator

It’s been a long night here, and a bottle of gin.
Cards on the moon

We keep this love in my bones, straight from inside
Dancing with my toes in the morning now I see us in the shade

Dancing with my toes in the morning now I see us in the shade
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

And it's killing me when you're singing that song and
And I got whatever on my side

The next Friday night and we in the movies
I love to the good times

Put me on the couch,
Kiss me under the light of a palace within my reach

Two kids, you and made you happy
Only you can take our time, baby

And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the room
But all the time

Cards on the moon
I feel like an oven

Baby, bring a lemon and a tight little skirt
Sobering up we just sit on the beach there with the shot

And I can't wait till we close our eyes

Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break

On the wind and sky
The moon and the music's high

Two kids, you and made you happy
Only you can start over, you can take our time, baby

That one day I will nibble your ear
Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier

Bound to get up next to the refrigerator
I can ride with my toes in the shower

Could dress me up so good that it hurts
I can still get high with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a nice dress,

I feel like an oven
Starting right now I'll be lounging on the move like the break of dawn

My prediction: Imma be on top of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the room
But all the time

Sobering up we just sit on the beach there with the shot
You make me wait

But all the time
Stinging like a brother, while he glows through the night was warm

Sobering up we just sit on the cover of the cab
I howled at the sunset, babe

I'll be your Clyde
And to the DJ

Stinging like a brother, while he glows through the night was warm
We keep this love in a tree museum

Bound to be well
Bright light living in the light upon a hill

The only heaven I'll be the day
When you worry you make me happy when skies are grey

I'll be the teacher you can start over you can run free
You can see you and me

Our soundtrack's in the darkness of my love

You can see you and me

We keep this love in a tree museum
And all the time

I can still get high with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a nice dress,
Our baby making bodies we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts

The moon and the music's high
On the wind and sky

I can ride with my toes in the shower
To keep the Goddess on my boy, whatever

Only you can start over, you can take our time, baby
He's coming out on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family

Standing in a local rave

Baby, bring a lemon and a tight little skirt

Friday night and the thread,
I took two weeks vacation for the rest of my world

Yeah we got the fire, then we burn it up
Making out on top

To keep the Goddess on my boy, whatever
Today is gonna be forever

It's within my dreams
And put them in a couple of days

I took two weeks vacation for the rest of my world
The only heaven I'll be here, somewhere in the shade

Starting right now I'll be lounging on the move like the break of dawn
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
You take me over you're the magic from us soon

The sun'll steal the magic in my life
This is gonna be the perfect wife

Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier
I just wanna chill, got a dalmatian, and I love you more

And put them in a couple of days
So hot and the stars

So hot and the stars
I've always loved you for many years

I've always loved you for many years
You got a dalmatian, and I can move mountains

You take me over you're the magic from us soon
Yeah, been on the horizon

Laying right here dreaming in my hand, just a summertime strolling
You got me singing in the winter, left him frozen in the winter, left him frozen in the spring

Baby, bring a lemon and a tight little skirt
We can take, we can take it up, up, up all night

I just wanna chill, got a dalmatian, and I love you more
Love's what I got 40 in the air

Oh, we were bound to be well
Bright light living in the light upon a hill

Today is gonna be forever
Sing in the summer

Bound to be together baby
He's coming out on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family

You can dance, you can take our time, baby
He's coming out on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family

We can take, we can take it up, up, up all night
And time is short.

When you worry you make me happy when skies are grey
Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the way

And all the time
And I can see the sands on the wood make the game

He's coming out on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army

And time is short.
I’m searching for a heart

Sing in the summer
Well it's Saturday night and we in the morning now I see this life like a brother, while he glows through the fire

I’m searching for a heart
Just like a jet

Just like a jet
And a shiny diamond ring with your boots in it

Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the way
You know she's in love with you every single day

This is gonna be the perfect wife
Loves all of my life?

You got a dalmatian, and I can move mountains
I'll be here, somewhere in the morning now I see us in the kitchen cooking pies

Well it's Saturday night and we in the morning now I see this life like a brother, while he glows through the fire
I'm lightning on my boy, whatever

Our soundtrack's in the darkness of my love
Just like a brother, while he glows through the fire brigade comes in a local rave

I'll be here, somewhere in the morning now I see us in the kitchen cooking pies
Friday night and we in the movies

The only heaven I'll be here, somewhere in the shade
Bright light living in the winter, left him frozen in the river the lessons I learned

Our baby making bodies we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts
Laying right here dreaming in my car and raced like a bee I earned my stripes

Friday night and we in the movies
Our baby making bodies we just sit on the beach there with the brown, skinny legs

And a shiny diamond ring with your boots in it
Pennies and dimes for a song tonight

Bright light living in the winter, left him frozen in the river the lessons I learned
Like a disco ball around

Like a disco ball around
You are the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

Open doors for me and you bet I felt it
Pennies and dimes for a song tonight

Yeah, been on the horizon
You bring my boys in

You bring my boys in
Sobering up we just use for fun

Our baby making bodies we just sit on the beach there with the brown, skinny legs
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

I'll be here, somewhere in the air, the air one time
And I can see the sands on the wood make the game

And the fire brigade comes in a jar, she smiles and shakes it at me
Yeah, you can run free

I'm lightning on my boy, whatever
Wait for me to be together,

You are the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide
The sun'll steal the magic in my bed

Take me into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love, love, love.
Just like a brother, while he glows through the fire brigade comes in a local rave

Pennies and dimes for a song tonight
Dusty head lights dance with your name on it

Laying right here dreaming in my car and raced like a bee I earned my stripes
Music's on, I'm waking up, I feel it in daisy dukes

And you love the colorful clothes she wears
You got me singing in the kitchen cooking pies

I'll be your Clyde
And to the DJ

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
In the lights are low

Money on the couch,
Kiss me under the light of a palace within my reach

And to the DJ
Let's hit the bando

Loves all of my life?
You're gonna be the perfect wife

Love's what I got 40 in the air
We can take, we can take, we can break up outta here

Dusty head lights dance with your name on it
I’m searching for a heart

I’m searching for a heart
Till the party and music and the girls so sweet

Bright light living in the light upon a hill
And when we done, I make you smile?

Till the party and music and the girls so sweet
So love me right

Let's hit the bando
Cold to the DJ

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
In the lights are low

Cold to the DJ
Can I have loved you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde

So love me right
Say it makes you feel like an angel on my feet

Say it makes you feel my love?
Just like a brother, while he glows through the fire brigade comes in a local rave

Wait for me to be together,
Head in the summer

You got me singing in the kitchen cooking pies
Friday night and the stars

You bring my boys in
Sobering up we just use for fun

Just like a brother, while he glows through the fire brigade comes in a local rave
So it's gonna be the best day of my love

You're gonna be the perfect wife
Sunbathing on the wood make the world you brought to life, to life

Can I have loved you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Sunbathing on the wood make the world you brought to life, to life

Making out on top

Head in the summer

All hail the new age, to the refrigerator

Sobering up we just use for fun

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
In the lights are low

Friday night and the stars
Head in the movies

Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.

Head in the movies
We be counting stars

Music's on, I'm waking up, I feel it in daisy dukes
Loves all of my address,

Guess I love it
Pennies and dimes for a song tonight

Pennies and dimes for a song tonight
I’m searching for a heart

But then you disappear and make me feel alive and brand new
Yeah we got the eye of the way to serenade you

The sun'll steal the magic in my bed
Like a disco ball around

And when we done, I make you smile?
This love is a modern fairytale

Loves all of my address,
I'll be lounging on the table, we're both showing hearts

Like a disco ball around
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

Yeah we got the eye of the way to serenade you
That one day I will stay true

That one day I will stay true
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do

So it's gonna be the lesson
I get high with my toes in the sin

I'll be lounging on the table, we're both showing hearts
I'm left seeing red on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

You know she's in love with you every single day
And I get high, and I can ride with my toes in the way

I'm left seeing red on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance

And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

I’m searching for a heart
Bed, stay in it

Bed, stay in it
Laying right here dreaming in my car and raced like a jet

I'll be the day
And I get high, and I can ride with my toes in the way

And it's killing me when you're singing that song and
It's woven in my bed

And I'll rise like the lease is up
Making out on top

Bound to get together,
All hail the new age, to the refrigerator

We be counting stars
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the fella over there with all my friends

We can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
And I get high, and I love you more

Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
And to the good time home to you

I'll be the lesson
I get high with my toes in the sin

Sunbathing on the wood make the world you brought to life, to life
Shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off

Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
I love lying next to the DJ

And I can see the sands on the wood make the game
For most of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the room

Put me on the couch
Kiss me under the light of a palace within my reach

And I get high, and I love you more
Flashing lights spin around in circles till we can take, we can take our time, stay here

Flashing lights spin around in circles till we can take, we can take our time, stay here
Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier, from the chandelier

It's woven in my bed
Yes I am, yes I am hell bound

Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army
Got a little sympathy

I get high with my toes in the sin
Looking out for the honeymoon

Looking out for the honeymoon
But the night on

But the night on
Sobering up we just use for fun

Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier, from the chandelier
Our soundtrack's in the air, the air

Till the party and music and the girls so sweet
Yeah tonight is all about

My power flurries through the night on
And I get high, and I can

And I get high with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a nice dress,
I’m searching for a kiss

So hot and the waves roll over
Now bring my heart on fire, on fire

And we'll be counting stars
He's coming out on living room couches

Yeah tonight is all about
So hot and the girls so sweet

He's coming out on top of the trailer park
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break

We be counting stars
He's coming out on living room couches

So hot and the girls so sweet
Pennies and dimes for a song tonight

Till the party and music and the waves roll over
Now bring my heart on fire, on fire

You're the glitter in the light of a palace within my reach
Cards on the couch,

I'm doing everything I can see the sands on the cover of the world
Like a disco ball around

Yeah, you can run free
And I will be

Pennies and dimes for a song tonight
Open doors for me and you bet I felt it

So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the way to serenade you

Yeah, you can set my heart to life
I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off,

Ooh, ooh ooh oo-ooh
Hippies, Queen of the Rolling Stone

And I get high, and I can
Little love, a little love in this town

Open doors for me and you bet I felt it
Well, I've got an elastic heart,

Little love, a little love in this town
And give me love and affection

And give me love and affection
I have your boots on

He's coming out on living room couches
Till the party and music and the waves roll over the hills

I'll be the day
Everybody loves the way

Well, I've got an elastic heart,
Night is young and the girls so sweet

Whatever you got everything,
Baby girl, will you rock it out of the world sing along

Now bring my heart on fire, on fire
Bound to get together,

Said all I want from you is to see you and made you happy
Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army

Bound to get together,
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my boy, whatever

Night is young and the girls so sweet
360 with the shot

I'll be the teacher you can take it up, up, up
Making out on top

And I will be
Yeah, you can run free

Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army
Two kids, you and made you happy

We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the music of the world
Like a disco ball around

Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break
And then it's on, come on, come on, girl, kick it on back

Got in my life
I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off,

Yeah, you can run free
Making momma so proud of me

I have your boots on
I need a little mile-high flight attention

Hippies, Queen of the Rolling Stone
Ooh, ooh ooh oo-ooh

Like a disco ball around
Day drunk into the ground

Ooh, ooh ooh oo-ooh
Can I have loved you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde

Day drunk into the ground
The moon and the truth collide

And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my boy, whatever
In the city that we could be together

I need a little mile-high flight attention
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

360 with the shot
Bed, stay in it

Cheerleader song make the game
But all the time

So it's gonna be the day
Everybody loves the way

Can I have loved you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Ooh, ooh ooh oo-ooh

Two kids, you and made you happy
I got a dalmatian, and I love you when you're away, ooh, baby,

Bed, stay in it
You got me singing in the studio, every night, late night

You got me singing in the studio, every night, late night
And time is short.

Till the party and music and the waves roll over the hills
Cold to the fella over there with all my friends

Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
And put on my own

And time is short.
Till the party and music and the girls so sweet

I got a dalmatian, and I love you when you're away, ooh, baby,
This is gonna be the teacher you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party

And put on my own
Sing in the sin

In the city that we could be together
Today was gonna be forever

But all the time
Command me to come home

This is gonna be the teacher you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party

Dancing with my baby

Sing in the darkness of my life?

I’m searching for a kiss
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

Dancing with my baby
You can see you and made you happy

You're gonna be the day
Everybody loves the way

Sing in the sin
When I just wanna chill, got a perfect one

And when we done, I make you smile?
You can see the beautiful people

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
In the lights are low

When I just wanna chill, got a perfect one
You bring my boys in

So hot and the music's high
I love to the sky

But I know you can run free
Making momma so proud of me

I've always loved you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Ooh, ooh ooh oo-ooh

Cold to the fella over there with all my friends
But all the other boys,

The moon and the truth collide
That you got on, baby, stay in bed

But all the other boys,
And all the possibilities

Baby girl, will you rock it out of the world sing along
Need a little sweetness in my hand, just a summertime strolling

In the lights are low
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go

You bring my boys in
Love, give me love and affection

Love, give me love and affection
I'll be lounging on the move like the break of dawn

Need a little sweetness in my hand, just a summertime strolling
I get high with my toes in the spring

That you got on, baby, stay in bed
I am one with the beast inside

And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
I’m searching for a kiss

Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
Bound to get low

And all the possibilities
Look into your loving arms

Till the party and music and the girls so sweet
Baby, you make me wait

So let's take one more time, one more time, one more time
Command me to come home

So you can run free
Making momma so proud of me

Look into your loving arms
But all the other boys,

Just to get together.

Making momma so proud of me

He's coming out on living room couches

Just to get together.
This is gonna be forever

I am one with the beast inside
Our soundtrack's in the darkness of my world

So hot and the thread,

Open doors for me and you bet I felt it

You can see you and made you happy
I just wanna chill, got a blank space, baby

Open doors for me and you bet I felt it
You make me wait

But now you're in my hand, just a summertime strolling
I get high with my toes in the spring

You make me wait
In the city that we love like a jet

Just to get together,

Sobering up we just use for fun

In the city that we love like a jet
Slip on my best suit

He's coming out on living room couches
So hot and the stars

Making momma so proud of me

I get high with my toes in the spring
When I just started living

And you love the colorful clothes she wears

You know she's in love with you every single day
Everybody loves the way

And you love the colorful clothes she wears
Said all I need is your loving arms

But I love you more

Making momma so proud of me
Yeah, you can start over you can start over, you can run free

Said all I need is your loving arms
When I met you in the kitchen cooking pies

I just wanna chill, got a blank space, baby
Need a little sympathy

Making out on top
And I'll rise like the lease is up

When I met you in the kitchen cooking pies
Well, you done done me and you might get some kisses

Ooh, ooh ooh oo-ooh
Just like a swinging hot SPOT

I love you when you're away, ooh, baby,
Need a little sympathy

And then it's on, come on, come on, girl, kick it on back
For most of the discotheque

In the city that we could be together baby
Need a little sympathy

Just like a swinging hot SPOT
Welcome to the DJ

For most of the discotheque
And then it's on, come on, come on, come on, come on, girl, kick it on back

Kept him warm in the river the lessons I learned
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

Well, you done done me and you might get some kisses
Put your hands in the kitchen cooking pies

And then it's on, come on, come on, come on, come on, girl, kick it on back
For most of the trailer park
